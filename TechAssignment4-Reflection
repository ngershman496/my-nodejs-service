Write a paragraph explaining what you learned from this assignment.
During this assignment I learned about node.js and how it works to serve a webservice on my local machine.
I learned about the app.yaml file (yet another markup language :) ) that is necessary to deploy my service. You cannot deploy without the app.yaml file.
I learned about how you can use Google's PaaS GCP (Google Cloud Platform) to host applications, webservers, and other services through the cloud.
I learned how to deploy my website through GCP and the process of creating projects and running them on GCP.
